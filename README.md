Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The model is built using Python and executed in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Aim
To classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand and explore the Iris dataset  
- To perform data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- To train a classification model using Logistic Regression  
- To evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📊 Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It contains **150 samples** with **4 numerical features**:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample belongs to one of the following classes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

The dataset is clean, balanced, and contains no missing values.

## 🔁 Methodology
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load the Iris dataset from file  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Encode categorical labels into numeric form  
5. Scale feature values  
6. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
7. Train the Logistic Regression model  
8. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset  
- Confusion matrix shows perfect classification  
- The model successfully predicts iris flower species
